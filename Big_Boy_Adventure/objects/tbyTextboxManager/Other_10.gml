/// @description (Re-)initialize variables

#region Explanation
/* Why do we initialize here and not in Create?
Simple answer: We re-use this script for
tbyReset() purposes.
Since deleting and re-creating the manager would
take until the next step after execution, it's
not an option if the user wants to reset
mid-dialogue. So this is the alternative.
You'll note that some variables do get defined in
the Create event. These need to exist during a reset
or a important for tracking the reset.*/
